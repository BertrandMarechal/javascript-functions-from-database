# javascript-functions-from-database

## Idea

I wanted to test the possibility to store and retrieve Javascript functions in a database, to deal with conversion functions.

I couldn't run those conversions in the database, as part of the data was coming from another source.

## Pre-requisites

- Local PostgreSQL instance
- nodeJS installed

## How to run

- Close this repo
- run npm install
- run npm start
